<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>Do you have a brick and mortar store that we can come and visit?</strong><br />No, currently are an internet only business, but we do hope open a bookstore one day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>How do you package my purchase for the mail?</strong><br />At Bookmarc's, we consider it a sign of our professionalism as booksellers that we pack books for mail shipment using materials and packing techniques that completely protect your book while it is enroute to you. Our intention is to package each book well enough that we are confident it will arrive in the same condition it was when we described it for our online catalog. At Bookmarc's, our intentions are always to do everything we can to make sure that our customers are completely satisified with their shopping experience with us.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>Does Bookmarc's sell books on any other site like ABEbooks, Alibris, </strong><strong>Amazon, </strong><strong>or Biblio?</strong> <br />We are currently selling on all four of those sites in addition to a few more.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>Where are you located and how long will it take me to get my order?</strong><br />We are located in La Porte, Texas, a suburb of Houston. Unless expedited air service is requested, all Bookmarc's domestic packages are shipped via USPS (i.e., United States Postal Service) 'media mail'. Media mail packages generally take about 5 to 10 business days to most locations in the lower forty-eight states. Please see our 'Shipping Information' page for more details.</p>
<p> <em><strong>I write you to confirm the book arrived well to Spain. It was very wall packaged. Thanks for sending it so fast!!!!</strong> -- Suso in Spain</em> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>Do you ship internationally?</strong><br />Yes we ship internationally, but we can only ship to most international addresses via airmail. If you want another option, please contact us prior to ordering for a quote. If you want insurance or any other postal options, please contact us prior to ordering for a quote as well as to confirm whether an option is actually available from the US to your address. We are only able to accept credit card payment for international orders.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"> </p>
<p> <em><strong>"I just received Mary Lasswell's book Mrs. "Rasmussen's Book of One-Arm Cookery." It arrived today and if that's what you call 'good' quality I love it! This book is in Very, Very Good condition and I thank you Very Very Much! Your site is now in My Favorites and I'll check back to see if you have any others I'm searching for." </strong>-- Darlene in Seattle</em> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>How do I know the condition of the book I am buying?</strong><br />We use traditional book condition rating terms including 'As New', 'Fine', 'Near Fine', 'Very Good', 'Good', 'Fair', and 'Poor'. We generally do not sell poor condition books unless the book is so scarce that even in this condition it is useful as a reading copy. Generally, we also will at times use a '+' (i.e., Plus) or '-' (i.e., Minus) to designate a book grate that is slightly better or worse than a stated grade (i.e., Very Good).<br /><br />A more detailed description of condition terms:<br /><br /><strong>AS NEW</strong>; <strong>FINE</strong>: Without faults or defects.<br /><br /><strong>NEAR FINE</strong>: a book approaching FINE (or AS NEW or MINT) but with a couple of very minor defects or faults, which are noted.<br /><br />[NOTE: From here on, there may be "+ (Plus)" or "- (Minus)" in a grade, which will mean that it is above the grade noted but not quite to the next higher grade for "+", and that it is below the grade noted but not quite to the next lower grade for "-", i.e., Very Good + (or Plus)/Very Good - (or Minus). Which means the book is better than Very Good and the dust jacket grade is less than Very Good.]<br /><br /><strong>VERY GOOD</strong>: A book showing some signs of wear. Any defects or faults are noted.<br /><br /><strong>GOOD</strong>: The average used book that is totally complete (as issued) and intact. Any defects are noted.<br /><br /><strong>FAIR</strong>: A worn book that has complete text pages (including those with maps or plates) but may lack endpapers, half-title page, etc. Any defects or faults are noted.<br /><br /><strong>POOR</strong>: A book that is sufficiently worn that its only merit is the complete text, which must be legible. Any missing maps or plates must be noted. May be soiled, scuffed, stained, or spotted, and may have loose joints, hinges, pages, etc.<br /><br />***In our condition descriptions we place a special emphasis on describing all book flaws in such a way that it is as easy as possible for a buyer to imagine a book's condition.***</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>What is a remainder mark?</strong><br />A remainder mark is a small mark on the side of the book or sometimes a small red star on the inside cover. It implies in no way that the book is defective or used. Publishers do this to protect themselves from the book being sold in the wholesale market to trade bookstore.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>Why don't you have ISBNs for all your books?</strong><br />International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) did not begin to be used for books published in the US until the very end of the 1960s. Even then, the adoption of this title identification system was only gradual and it was implemented inconsistently. To confuse matters even further, similar books often have numerous ISBNs due to each country’s edition having its own country as part of the ISBN as well as different ISBNs being provided for reprints and other minor edition revisions. At Bookmarc's, we provide book ISBNs only when they are printed in the book or on its cover or dust jacket.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>What language is the book?</strong><br />Generally, the books we sell are in the language of their title. All of Bookmarc's book descriptions clearly state the language the book is printed if it is not English. Our descriptions will even list the languages used for books printed in English as well as one or more other languages (i.e., bilingual, interlinear translations, etc.). In any situation where there the posibility of confusion might arise we will always clearly state the language of the book in the book description.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>How do I cancel or change my order?</strong><br />Please contact us as soon as possible if you want to cancel or change your order. Generally we try to ship orders within one day so if we receive the changes in time, we will do our best to stop the package before it goes out the door. If we are unable to stop the book, we have a generous and very reasonable return policy and will work with you to make everything all right. In all fairness, we generally do not refund shipping charges on returned orders if the correct item is shipped and the condition description is correct. Still, we want to make you happy with your Bookmarc's experience so please feel free to contact us. We are confident that we can work out a solution to any problem that comes up regarding your order.</p>

<p> <em><strong>"Thanks so much for your timely and professional shipping of the J. Frank Dobie book to the Kansas address. I've kept your card and will do business with you again."</strong> -- David in Kansas</em> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>What if I get a book I did not order? What if I have received the wrong order?</strong> <br />If you receive anything different than what you have ordered, please contact us. We will correct our mistake as soon as possible.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><strong>What if my order does not come in the time expected?</strong><br />If you have any concerns about the arrival of your order, please contact us. Our packages are shipped with USPS tracking numbers so we can usually help you find out the location and estimated delivery date for your books. Generally, you can expect your order to arrive in about 4 to 7 business days (do not count Saturdays, Sundays or Holidays). It is uncommon but possible for a package to take as long as ten business days to arrive. Even though most of the orders we ship arrive within the 4 to 7 day estimate, the official post office delivery time for Media Mail packages is between about 5 to 10 business days. Again, please contact us if you are concerned about the arrival of your package. Your order is important to us! We want you to be happy and receive your books as soon as possible. (Delivery time estimates are for US addresses only.)</p>
